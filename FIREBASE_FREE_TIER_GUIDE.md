# 🔥 Firebase Free Tier Setup - No Payment Required!

Firebase has a **FREE tier** (Spark plan) that is perfect for this project. You don't need to pay anything!

---

## ✅ What You Can Do for FREE

The Firebase **Spark (Free) Plan** includes:

### Authentication
- ✅ **Unlimited** email/password authentications
- ✅ Email verification
- ✅ User management

### Firestore Database
- ✅ **1 GB storage** (plenty for thousands of issues)
- ✅ **50,000 reads/day**
- ✅ **20,000 writes/day**
- ✅ **20,000 deletes/day**

### Storage
- ✅ **5 GB storage** (for issue images)
- ✅ **1 GB downloads/day**
- ✅ **20,000 uploads/day**

**This is MORE than enough for a campus issue reporting system!**

## 🚨 If You See "Upgrade" Prompts

Firebase might show upgrade prompts, but you can still use the free tier:

### Option 1: Use Free Tier (Recommended)
1. When you see upgrade prompts, look for **"Continue with Spark plan"** or **"Use free tier"**
2. Click that option
3. You can use Firebase without billing

### Option 2: Enable Billing (Still Free)
Some features require billing to be enabled, but you **won't be charged** if you stay within free limits:

1. Go to Firebase Console → **Project Settings** → **Usage and billing**
2. Click **"Upgrade to Blaze plan"**
3. **Don't worry!** You'll see:
   - "You won't be charged unless you exceed free tier limits"
   - "Free tier limits apply"
4. Add a payment method (required, but won't charge you)
5. You can still use everything for FREE as long as you stay within limits

**Important:** Firebase only charges if you exceed free tier limits. For a campus app, you'll likely never exceed them!

## 💡 Alternative: If You Really Can't Use Firebase

If you absolutely cannot use Firebase (even free tier), here are alternatives:

### Option A: Use Firebase Emulator (Local Development)
- Run Firebase locally on your computer
- No account needed
- Good for testing only

### Option B: Use Mock Data (Development Only)
- I can modify the app to work with mock data
- No backend needed
- Only for UI testing

### Option C: Use Another Free Backend
- Supabase (free tier)
- Appwrite (self-hosted free)
- PocketBase (self-hosted free)

## 🎯 Recommended: Try Free Tier First

**Most likely scenario:** You can use Firebase for free!

1. **Try creating a project** - it should work without payment
2. **If you see upgrade prompts**, look for "Continue with free tier" option
3. **If it requires billing**, enable it - you won't be charged unless you exceed limits (which is very unlikely)

---

## 📊 Free Tier Limits (You Probably Won't Hit These)

For a campus app with ~100-500 students:

- **Firestore:** 50,000 reads/day = ~2,000 reads/hour = plenty!
- **Storage:** 5 GB = ~10,000 images (if 500KB each)
- **Authentication:** Unlimited

**You'll likely use less than 10% of free tier limits!**
